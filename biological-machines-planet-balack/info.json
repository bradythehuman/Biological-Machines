  "author": "bradythehuman",
  "description": "Adds Balack, a post aquilo planet centered around a new building, the bio fabricator, which can only be placed at the origin and produces lots of pollution. A unique scrap resource can be turned into ammo and building supplies to defend the fabricator against powerful enemies. The fabricator is required to produce new speed+quality module, tank mk2, mech armor mk2 and warp drive. Both balack and the shattered planet require promethium science which can be mined on some inner planets",
