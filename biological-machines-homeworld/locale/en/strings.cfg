bm-station-input=Deposited construction materials will be removed and tracked.
bm-station-output=Credits are deposited as payment for construction materials. Also serves as a source of free power.
bm-interstellar-energy-link=Provides free power from the dyson sphere. The targeting mechanism only allows 1 link to be active per surface.
bm-inactive-interstellar-energy-link=Inactive because there was already a link on this surface.

bm-dyson-sphere=An incomplete but functional dyson sphere. Deposit construction materials (in green box) for credits (in gold box) to buy other materials from the market.
bm-new-system=One of many uncolonized worlds identified by the homeworld. Remotely send a space platform with a suspended clone to the system to establish a colony. WARNING: The platform will be removed and credits will be paid out on the dyson sphere construction platform.

intro-msg=Welcome to Biological Machines! You are a clone worker sent on a sleeper ship to colonize an uninhabited star system. Build a space platform capable of interstellar travel and return to your homeworld with materials needed to construct a dyson sphere.
victory-title=Victory!
victory-message=[font=default-bold]Congradulations!\nYou have beaten the game by sending a clone on an interstellar space platform to colonize a new world![/font]\n\nYou can continue playing this level as long as you like. __1__ credits were deposited on the Dyson sphere construction platform and the same amount will be paid every time another clone is sent to colonize a new world.
victory-final=Thanks for playing.\nbradythehuman
